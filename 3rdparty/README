Prebuilt binaries are located in the prebuilt directory, to save the effort
of rebuilding them. However, if you want to make changes or use different
versions of the libraries, here are the instructions to do so.
Once they are built, you will either need to reconfigure the include and
library paths to point to your versions, or copy them on top of the prebuilt
versions here.

Building DOSBox dependencies
There are a number of dependency libraries required. 
- SDL 1.2 - https://github.com/blackberry/SDL
- SDL_sound - Follow the instructions in the SDL_sound subdirectory.
- TouchControlOverlay - https://github.com/blackberry/TouchControlOverlay
- libogg - https://github.com/blackberry/OggVorbis
- libvorbis - https://github.com/blackberry/OggVorbis

Notes: 
The OggVorbis repository is a little strange at the moment. You will have to
build it using the command line but also import it as a project (called vorbis).
